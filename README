This app will be a communications app for the Wharton IT department. Users of this app will be able to create a maintenance event (either Emergency or Scheduled), specify a severity, and alert individuals that are either associated with the systems involved or the groups involved. Furthermore, 2 contacts will be associated with each event. These users will be able to post messages and updates for the event which the other users/subscribers will be notified of. All users will be able to comment on messages of an event, as well.

Currently, the backend is implemented using SQLite, which means the data is local to each device. In the future, we will implement a persistent, distributed database and store all information there to create a truly interactive application.
