This app will be a communications app for the Wharton IT department. Users of this app will be able to create a maintenance event (either Emergency or Scheduled), specify a severity, and alert individuals that are either associated with the systems or the groups involved. Furthermore, 2 contacts will be associated with each event. These users will be able to post messages and updates for the event which the other users/subscribers will be notified of. All users will be able to comment on messages of an event, as well.
